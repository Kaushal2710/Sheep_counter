# Sheep_counter

Imagine a flock of sheep, one by one moving in and out of a fenced grassland. Now the shepherd wants a device attached to the fence door that keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land. So this is the required device.

The sheep counter works on use of Ultrasonic hc-sr04.

Gate width should be changed according to the need.

There are two sensors so when a sheep passes through one sensor and then passes from another sensor, the counter is increased.
In case of sheep returning back, the counter is reduced in a similar way.
The two sensor model helps in getting the accurate counter.
